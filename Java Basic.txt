Java Basics
===========

Object Oriented Programming
============================

Class - is like blue print
Object - is like the bulit house out of the blue print
     -- multiple object can be created for a class
	 
	 
Abstraction - check for the details required
Encapsulation - inbuilt details that are hidden from the system
Inheritance - inherit from another class
Polymorphism - based on the context the behaviour differs

Overridding - can change the details that are inherited in the lower class as per the context


Static - 
Final - can not change the implementaion of it... this is used for variable and methord's 
Abstract -  Can be used in class level and methord's. 
		- abstract in class can not used to 
		-  Abstract methord has to be implemented in abstract class. this methord should only be decleared (body should not be given)
		- In inherited (extended class) the Abstract methord has to be defined.
		

		
Class can be extended. Extend only one class
Interface class - implements class -- all methord are abstract 100% -- can implemnts many class



Debugging:
==========

-- set breakpoint.
-- F6 to run line by line
-- F8 to continue running
